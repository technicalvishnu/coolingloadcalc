# Cooling Load Calculator of a Building

## Introduction

This project aims to create a program that calculates the cooling load for a building based on user input. The program uses various inputs such as the area of the building, number of occupants, type of building, outdoor and indoor temperatures, and applies mathematical calculations to determine the cooling load.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a program that provides an efficient and user-friendly way to estimate the cooling load of a building. This program can be particularly useful for architects, engineers, and HVAC professionals who need to assess the cooling requirements for different types of buildings.

## Project Scope (SCOPE Students)

As part of the SCOPE program, the student Vishnu Samudrala worked on creating a cooling load calculator program. The program was developed using Python and included in this repository.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting building and environmental parameters.
- Differentiates between residential and commercial buildings for accurate cooling load calculations.
- Accounts for heat transfer due to conduction and provides the final sensible cooling load.

## Getting Started

To use the program:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the web-based cooling load calculator.
2. Fill in the required inputs such as area, number of occupants, building type, outdoor and indoor temperatures.
3. Click the "Calculate" button to obtain the sensible cooling load.

## Included Code

This repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: HTML file for the web-based cooling load calculator.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the web page.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the calculation logic.
- `cooling_load_calculator.py`: Python program for calculating the cooling load.
